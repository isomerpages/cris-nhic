<h3>Translating innovations and breakthroughs into global healthcare solutions requires more than just cutting-edge technology.</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>The commentary by Dr Pauline Tay, Director, National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC), discusses how Singapore can translate innovations and breakthroughs into global healthcare solutions.</strong>

<p>These locally developed innovations include uSINE, an AI-powered ultrasound
for more precise epidural administration at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital
and the AeviceMD smart stethoscope for detecting lung abnormalities.</p>
<p>Supported by NHIC, these advancements reflect the country’s position as
the fourth-most innovative economy globally. However, developing and scaling
medical technologies remains a complex process, often taking years due
to stringent research, trials, and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>As Singapore’s population ages, accelerating innovation becomes crucial
to improving healthcare efficiency and addressing rising patient needs.
To fast-track medical advancements, stronger local collaboration and international
partnerships are essential. Success stories like Klaro, a surgical lighting
device, and SELENA+, an AI-powered eye-screening tool, demonstrate how
Singapore-developed innovations can expand globally through strategic alliances.</p>
<p>Overcoming regulatory and market-entry challenges requires deeper connections
between innovators, hospitals, and investors. While NHIC will continue
to play a key role in supporting the health-tech innovations of clinicians
in Singapore, sustainable progress will depend on shared commitment and
investment from all stakeholders to co-develop solutions that address the
pressing healthcare challenges across the world.</p>
