<p><em>The journey from healthcare innovation to commercialisation is multi-faceted, requiring collaboration, strategic planning and partnerships, along with robust IP protection and strategies. IP rights, patents, and licensing are essential components of an effective IP strategy, which allows the protection and scaling of innovative ideas with the potential for wide-reaching impact.</em>
</p>
<p><em>This </em><strong><em>World Intellectual Property Day</em></strong><em>, we shine a spotlight on how the National Health Innovation Centre (NHIC) partners with the three public healthcare clusters to assist clinician innovators in protecting their original ideas and maintain a competitive edge. </em>These
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The National Healthcare Group’s (NHG) <a href="https://corp.nhg.com.sg/CMTI/Pages/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Centre for Medical Technologies and Innovations (CMTi)</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National University Health System (<a href="https://www.nuhs.edu.sg/research/Pages/about-NUHS-research-office.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NUHS) Research Office</a>
</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Each of these offices support their clinical innovators in developing their novel ideas into solutions which address unmet healthcare needs, and in test-bedding these solutions in real-world healthcare settings. Additionally, they manage a vast range of responsibilities from guiding, protecting, commercialising inventions, and serving as a one-stop access for innovators within their clusters.</em>
</p>
<p><em>In our conversations with representatives from each healthcare cluster, they share insights into the importance of protecting the IPs, success stories, and the ongoing collaborative efforts with NHIC to foster an ecosystem conducive to healthcare innovation.</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>Enabling collaborative innovation together with NHIC</strong></h4>
<p>NHIC supports clinical innovations from ideation through development to
commercialisation and adoption, powering the next generation of healthcare
innovation. In particular, the <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/funding/protect-i2p/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Innovation to Protect (I2P) support scheme</a> provides
funding to fund patent expenses for patentable inventions with demonstrated
proof of concepts.</p>
<p>To further enhance the innovation and enterprise ecosystem, NHIC also
supports each cluster through events, consultancy services, workshops and
stakeholder engagement to ensure that clinical innovators receive the necessary
support to navigate the process of commercialisation and market access
including applying for IP rights effectively.</p>

<p><em>Dr Alfred Chia, Senior Assistant Director (left) and Zhang Bo, Senior Executive (right) at NUHS Research Office provide support to researchers and investigators across NUHS at every step of the innovation journey to help them stay at the forefront of innovation in healthcare.</em>
</p>
<p>Highlighting the importance of these outreach efforts, <strong>Dr Alfred Chia, Senior Assistant Director </strong>at <strong>NUHS Research Office</strong> notes
the critical role of understanding the landscape, including prior art,
to enhance the success of patent applications. These initiatives aim to
benefit not just NUHS but the broader public healthcare innovation ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Often, innovators file for patents based on what they think is inventive
and novel, however, they do not consider the competitors or what we call
“prior art” (<em>which refers to any invention which has been made available to the public anywhere in the world by written or oral disclosure before the Principal Investigator’s (PI) patent application is filed</em>),”
he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Zhang Bo</strong>, <strong>Senior Executive</strong> at the <strong>Innovation Transfer Office </strong>at
the NUHS Research Office shared that navigating the intricacies of innovation
also involves tough decisions such as saying “no”. Despite clinicians'
initial excitement about their ideas, Zhang Bo added that at times, he
had to turn down concepts that may not be feasible due to the lack of inventiveness
or because the idea did not demonstrate significant improvement on prior
art.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Erin Teo</strong>, <strong>Assistant Director</strong> at <strong>SHIP</strong> added:
“In order for a patent application to secure a strong patent position,
it should be filed before the researcher publishes or publicly discloses
their invention. As such, education of researchers is of pivotal importance.”</p>
<p></p>

<p><em>Dr Erin Teo, Assistant Director (left) and Chole Chu, Assistant Manager (right) at SHIP guide clinicians and researchers towards protecting their inventions and moving it along commercialisation pathways that will improve the lives of patients and deliver better healthcare.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The dedication of these officers at the healthcare clusters ensure that
ground-breaking ideas are not only protected but also supported from early-on,
so that it can develop further and be brought to market eventually.</p>
<p>At the core of these endeavours, the teams from each of these clusters
also encourage open dialogue and collaboration to streamline the innovation
process within their respective clusters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;NHG CMTi, for example, has the mandate to drive the end-to-end Innovation
and Enterprise (I&amp;E) ecosystem in NHG.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They collaborate with research institutions to identify research outcomes
that can be translated into real-world applications, as well as support
the development of innovative ideas, facilitate clinical and validation
trials, and coordinate their implementation and adoption. Additionally,
CMTi provides NHG PIs access to venture building networks, where budding
start-ups and spin-offs are formed and supported, contributing to a conducive
ecosystem for innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, the NHG CMTi I&amp;E ecosystem is well-oiled to oversee IP
management, cross-institution collaborations, and drive the development
of clinicians’ ideas towards tangible products with an eye for commercialisation.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Hannah Chong, Assistant Manager (left) and Evangeline Ng, Manager (right) at CMTi support NHG’s clinician innovators to transform good ideas into an eventual product.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Over the years, the innovation culture in Singapore has shifted to steer
the end point focus of innovation and enterprise beyond development towards
adoption and commercialisation. Centralising IP management at NHGHQ level,
gives us an overview of the IP assets. This allows the team to ensure timely
and strategic management of these Intangible Assets.” said <strong>Evangeline Ng</strong>, <strong>Manager at CMTi, NHG Group Research and Innovation</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“At CMTi, we play a deep seeding role at the developmental stage, guiding
clinicians to mine for unmet clinical needs and match them with competent
partners to translate these into products. Through the process, we work
with partners like NHIC, National Medical Research Council (NMRC) and Singapore
Biodesign to groom clinician innovators through national-level funding
and talent development programmes. Eventually, we facilitate the adoption
and commercialisation of new technologies, through coordination of test
bedding, trials and new venture creation,” said <strong>Hannah Chong</strong>, <strong>Assistant Manager at CMTi, NHG Group Research and Innovation</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We appreciate NHIC’s advice. They guide us towards developing innovations
in the deep tech space. This proactive approach not only increases our
chances of securing the right grants but also enhances the quality of research
and innovation within our ecosystem,” added Hannah.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Another primary challenge faced by institutions in the healthcare sector
is that many innovations are still in early-stage, and hence to reach the
technology transfer stage would take a relatively longer runway,” said <strong>Chole Chu, Assistant Manager</strong> at <strong>SHIP</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To alleviate some of these challenges, NHIC jointly collaborates with
each of the public healthcare clusters in setting up <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/programmes/funding/joint-medtech-grants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Joint MedTech Grant (JMT)</a> to
support and propel the technology readiness level of early-stage innovations.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both Evangeline and Hannah shared that the synergy between CMTi and NHIC
has enabled NHG PIs to strengthen project proposals, gain deeper insights
into market analysis and better assess the suitability of their proposals
when applying for different grant schemes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent milestones for the CMTi team include supporting more than 300 clinician
innovators to-date and managing more than 380 active innovation projects.
In the past year, they have completed 23 IP filings and 24 IP disclosures.</p>
<p>Evangeline cited a significant project which NHIC had supported since
the early stage of development. The project received seed funding through
the <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/funding/joint-medtech-grants/nhg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NHG CMTi-NHIC Joint MedTech Grant</a> (NHG
CMTi-NHIC JMT) alongside NHG funding, to develop an AI-powered algorithm
software and dermoscope that is universal, affordable and attachable to
analyse skin images from consumer-grade cameras. The software provides
a fast and accurate method to detect high risk or malignant skin lesions.
It eliminates the need for bulky or multiple devices to capture and transfer
skin images for analysis, allowing for prompt follow-up care for patients.</p>
<p>Evangeline also highlighted an ongoing project where the PI is developing
a first-of-its-kind non-invasive device that uses magnets and blood flow
sensing technology to assess patients’ blood vessels for signs of inflammation
and detect potential vascular complications in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>With NHIC’s support, the patent was filed together with a local polytechnic.
The project has also garnered funding support from NHIC’s <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/funding/develop-i2d/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Innovation to Develop (I2D)</a> grant
and progressed to receive the <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/funding/industry-i2i/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Innovation to Industry (I2I)</a> grant
support where it continues to be developed.</p>
<p></p>

<p><em>NHIC supports clinical innovations from ideation through development to commercialisation and adoption through various grant schemes.</em>
</p>
<p>“NHIC’s I2P funding scheme has enabled the filing of this IP which was
supported through its I2D and I2I programmes. In collaboration with our
partners, we are excited to see the continued development of this product.
We hope it will move towards commercialisation one day,” said Evangeline.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Advancing market access for healthcare innovations</u></strong></h4>
<p>For healthcare innovations looking to enter the market, navigating market
fragmentation due to differences in the healthcare systems, workflows,
country-specific regulations, and clinical needs are some key considerations.
Innovators also need to factor in ensuring sufficient IP protection and
thorough survey of competitive market environments.</p>
<p>To overcome these hurdles, a deep understanding of the selected market,
a robust network of collaborators, coupled with a strong strategy are essential
for success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alfred from NUHS shared a recent success story which involved a portable
user-guided visual acuity test developed by a PI, that allows patients
to independently measure their eyes’ ability to distinguish shapes and
colours. After a meticulous three-year prototyping process, the PI was
looking for a commercialisation partner and several companies were eager
to collaborate.</p>
<p>This project was memorable as the team had to overcome the challenge of
simultaneously submitting regulatory documents and securing licensing terms
for the device. Together with NHIC, the NUHS Research Office also provided
guidance to the commercial partner on win-win ways to carry out the technology
transfer process with the PI.</p>
<p>“Thanks to support from our partners, including NHIC, we achieved regulatory
approval from the Health Sciences Authority in less than three months –
a remarkable feat – from prototype to market,” said Alfred.</p>
<p>In the roadmap ahead, this invention will be a key component of a suite
of community-based vision screening tools that will leverage AI to detect
disease-related visual impairment and measure intraocular pressure for
glaucoma monitoring. Alfred shared that the team’s next focus is to identify
distribution opportunities for this device across Asia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“NHIC has been a very important partner to the NUHS Research Office as
we evaluate the market potential of ideas together,” said Alfred. “When
PIs and researchers are successful in their grant applications for their
IP, it motivates other innovators to get their IP applications backed by
a national programme office such as NHIC,” he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hannah from NHG also highlighted a memorable innovation from the National
Skin Centre (NSC), which developed a clinical-grade pain alleviation device
that provides vibrational stimulus to relief discomfort on the skin and
offer pain management during dermatological procedures such as cryotherapy.</p>
<p>This pain alleviation device addresses a gap in the clinical setting,
and presentations about its technology and how it works has been well received
by dermatologists at both local and international conferences.</p>
<p>In the early days, this innovation received funding support from the NHG
CMTi-NHIC JMT grant. Along the development pathway, this device was also
licensed to an industry partner for further commercialisation.</p>
<p>“We are also thankful for opportunities to be invited by NHIC to co-exhibit
at trade events. Interestingly, at the Singapore Week of Innovation and
Technology (SWITCH) 2022, the device was showcased within NHIC's booth
and this innovation's commercialisation partner received its first overseas
order at the event,” said Hannah.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Striking a balance to optimise resources</u></strong></h4>
<p>Chole<strong> </strong>from SingHealth<strong> </strong>shared that the
path of bringing an idea from bench to bedside requires a hardy resolve
to overcome hurdles and strike a delicate balance of allocating available
resources.</p>
<p>“Hence, our team would have to evaluate new inventions while managing
the existing IP portfolio,” said Chole.</p>
<p>Erin recalled a memorable project supported by various NHIC grants to
support the technology transfer and commercialise a device to treat patients
with a condition that causes heart valve leaks or “leaky heart”.</p>
<p>“It was a technical medical device with many aspects – from how it was
engineered, to its deployment. Together with the NHIC team, we advised
the PI on the various patents that may be applicable to this device,” said
Erin.</p>
<p>She illustrated that the idea was to have “a very comprehensive and strong
patent “army” (<em>sufficient patents to cover various aspects of the innovation (i.e. core technology, methods, design) as protection against competitors and intellectual property infringement</em>)
that would allow the device to be licensed into a start-up, and hence it
was crucial to “ensure all patentable aspects were covered.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“NHIC's ongoing support, particularly through the I2P scheme, has been
instrumental in enhancing SHIP’s ability to protect and manage its intellectual
property assets,” she added.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><u>Forging future collaborations for the road ahead</u></strong></h4>
<p>Looking ahead, the representatives from all three clusters note that there
are ample opportunities for deeper collaboration with NHIC for the road
ahead.</p>
<p>These include leveraging shared resources and expertise in regulatory
guidance, business strategy, and technical development for capability development
of the innovators within the clusters.</p>

Group (NHG) –&nbsp; to advise budding companies and start-ups on how to
track their development roadmap, draw up targets towards significant project
milestones and offer advice on industry partners they can connect with
on their innovation journey.</p>
<p>There are also plans to conduct a workshop on IP portfolio and strategies
in partnership with NUHS in the coming year that will be open for all clinical
innovators from public healthcare clusters / academic medical schools /
healthtech institutes. These partnerships ensure clinical innovators receive
tailored guidance and access to appropriate resources.</p>
<p>The healthcare innovation journey requires teams to adeptly navigate the
dynamic intersection where healthcare intersects with science, business,
and innovation. Further support such as these will strengthen partnerships
and drive impactful innovation in healthcare.</p>
