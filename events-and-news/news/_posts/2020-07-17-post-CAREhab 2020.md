Asia’s annual premier healthcare platform CAREhab 2020 and conference element 6th Singapore Rehabilitation Conference, will now be held online on the 17 – 18 July 2020.

A platform dedicated to the healthcare community, most of whom are now serving on the frontline to fight against the pandemic, the CME & CPE approved digital edition of CAREhab – Singapore Rehabilitation Conference 2020 will have the added benefit of allowing the community to access content in their own time, while featuring components that mirror the physical event they're familiar with. The co-organisers remain committed to ensuring the event on its new platform facilitates conversations and new collaborations among all event participants as it breaks new grounds for Asia-Pacific’s healthcare sector.  
  
More details on the digital platform, and how you can navigate it, will be shared at a later date on the official CAREhab 2020 website. In the meantime, please contact the team at [carehab@singex.com](mailto:carehab@singex.com) for further enquiries.
