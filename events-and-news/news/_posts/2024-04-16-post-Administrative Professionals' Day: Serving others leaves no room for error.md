<h4><strong>Service at the heart of what she does – this administrative professional believes that serving others leaves no room for error</strong></h4>
<p><em>Being an administrative professional is no longer a deskbound job, it has since evolved into a multifaceted role today. Administrative professionals now embrace a broader spectrum of responsibilities — from deconflicting schedules to events liaison to strategic stakeholder management; extending beyond traditional notions.</em>
</p>
<p><em>This Administrative Professionals' Day, we speak with </em><strong><em>Ng San San, Assistant Manager (Grants and Administration), National Innovation Healthcare Centre Singapore (NHIC)</em></strong><em>, as she shares her passion for the work it takes to support her team and remain ahead of the curve.</em>
</p>
<p>Growing up, San San preferred to listen, observe, and do her work quietly.
While she usually knew the answers to questions, she didn’t feel the need
to shout them out. She valued calmness and solitude over the bustle of
activities in boisterous crowds.</p>
<p>“I have always considered myself an extreme introvert,” San San said with
a soft laugh. Despite holding a certification as an accounts technician,
she opted for a receptionist role at an architectural firm as her first
job. Back then, most of her peers were going into roles such as marketing
and sales. She attributed the choice to her quiet personality, acknowledging
that roles which demanded the “gift of the gab” were not the ideal fit
for her.</p>
<p>Yet, after two decades, San San seamlessly navigates her role as an administrative
professional, having worked across various industries — education, healthcare
and banking. As the Assistant Manager (Grants and Administration) at NHIC,
a role she assumed in 2022, San San oversees various administrative tasks,
including managing logistics and providing support to colleagues during
events.</p>
<p>How did this self-proclaimed introvert thrive in a role which demands
constant communication with people from various backgrounds and the ability
to anticipate their needs? What fuels her passion? The joy of service and
problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stepping out of her comfort zone, stepping into service</strong></h4>
<p>San San fondly recalls her early days at a wellness brand, where she served
as an Accounts Administrator. As the company expanded rapidly, the need
arose for staff to step into service-oriented roles. Her boss, whom she
refers to as a “wonderful mentor”, recommended her to take up the challenge,
pointing out that while she may be a very quiet person, she had a knack
for connecting with people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was quite surprised. How can someone as reserved as me excel in serving
others?" she said.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only did it demand frequent interactions with people, but it also
required mastering aspects of customer service which she was unfamiliar
with. However, with her mentor’s encouragement, San San took a step out
of her comfort zone.</p>
<p>Indeed, her mentor's intuition proved to be spot on — she was a natural.
San San soon realised that in her quiet demeanour, she possessed a keen
eye for detail and an innate ability to understand people's needs. She
was able to provide assistance with ease, whether resolving administrative
matters or addressing customer inquiries. "There was a genuine satisfaction
in helping my colleagues and assisting customers," San San recalls.</p>
<p>This marked a pivotal moment in her career—a confident shift towards corporate
administration, a role which provided her with an environment suited to
her introverted nature while also enabling her to effectively support diverse
stakeholders in their work.</p>
<p>“It was the best of both worlds,” San San described.</p>
