<h4><strong>Service at the heart of what she does – this administrative professional believes that serving others leaves no room for error</strong></h4>
<p><em>Being an administrative professional is no longer a deskbound job, it has since evolved into a multifaceted role today. Administrative professionals now embrace a broader spectrum of responsibilities — from deconflicting schedules to events liaison to strategic stakeholder management; extending beyond traditional notions.</em>
</p>
<p><em>This Administrative Professionals' Day, we speak with </em><strong><em>Ng San San, Assistant Manager (Grants and Administration), National Innovation Healthcare Centre Singapore (NHIC)</em></strong><em>, as she shares her passion for the work it takes to support her team and remain ahead of the curve.</em>
</p>
<p>Growing up, San San preferred to listen, observe, and do her work quietly.
While she usually knew the answers to questions, she didn’t feel the need
to shout them out. She valued calmness and solitude over the bustle of
activities in boisterous crowds.</p>
<p>“I have always considered myself an extreme introvert,” San San said with
a soft laugh. Despite holding a certification as an accounts technician,
she opted for a receptionist role at an architectural firm as her first
job. Back then, most of her peers were going into roles such as marketing
and sales. She attributed the choice to her quiet personality, acknowledging
that roles which demanded the “gift of the gab” were not the ideal fit
for her.</p>

</div>
<p>Yet, after two decades, San San seamlessly navigates her role as an administrative
professional, having worked across various industries — education, healthcare
and banking. As the Assistant Manager (Grants and Administration) at NHIC,
a role she assumed in 2022, San San oversees various administrative tasks,
including managing logistics and providing support to colleagues during
events.</p>
<p>How did this self-proclaimed introvert thrive in a role which demands
constant communication with people from various backgrounds and the ability
to anticipate their needs? What fuels her passion? The joy of service and
problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stepping out of her comfort zone, stepping into service</strong></h4>
<p>San San fondly recalls her early days at a wellness brand, where she served
as an Accounts Administrator. As the company expanded rapidly, the need
arose for staff to step into service-oriented roles. Her boss, whom she
refers to as a “wonderful mentor”, recommended her to take up the challenge,
pointing out that while she may be a very quiet person, she had a knack
for connecting with people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was quite surprised. How can someone as reserved as me excel in serving
others?" she said.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only did it demand frequent interactions with people, but it also
required mastering aspects of customer service which she was unfamiliar
with. However, with her mentor’s encouragement, San San took a step out
of her comfort zone.</p>
<p>Indeed, her mentor's intuition proved to be spot on — she was a natural.
San San soon realised that in her quiet demeanour, she possessed a keen
eye for detail and an innate ability to understand people's needs. She
was able to provide assistance with ease, whether resolving administrative
matters or addressing customer inquiries. "There was a genuine satisfaction
in helping my colleagues and assisting customers," San San recalls.</p>
<p>This marked a pivotal moment in her career—a confident shift towards corporate
administration, a role which provided her with an environment suited to
her introverted nature while also enabling her to effectively support diverse
stakeholders in their work.</p>
<p>“It was the best of both worlds,” San San described.</p>
<h4><strong>Being a jack of all trades</strong></h4>
<p>Contrary to the common perception of administrative professionals spending
their days hunched over their desks and buried in paperwork, San San emphasised
the evolving nature of the job. "It's about being a jack of all trades,"
she explained. As the main liaison of NHIC, she takes a proactive approach,
always ready for any unexpected tasks which may fall outside the defined
job scopes.</p>
<p>In addition to assisting NHIC Director, Dr Pauline Tay, on managing her
busy schedule and working closely with event organisers to manage her speaking
engagements and industry event invitations, San San diligently checks in
on the team's calendars at NHIC. This enables her to arrange meetings like
team retreats and board meetings, reducing the risk of miscommunication
and keep things running along smoothly for the entire team. Her attention
to detail ensures she can readily provide assistance whenever required.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Admin Professionals' Day/Ng_San_San_2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Indeed, coordinating meetings starts with “finding the right slot”, everything
else falls into place. After confirming a date, San San sends the visitors
a comprehensive information kit. This includes a step-by-step directory
to locate the building easily, along with instructions upon reaching the
lobby. Anticipating their needs, she even guides them to facilities like
washrooms or coffee machines before the meeting begins.</p>
<p>Asked if she thought of that as going the extra mile, San San gently shook
her head and said, “I think it is important to ensure every detail is covered
to minimise any inconvenience for our visitors.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>San San's familiarity with most aspects of NHIC's operations enables her
to provide support effortlessly. "I'm like a human help desk," she said
with a laugh.</p>
<p>In her previous role as the Executive Assistant to the Group Chief Information
Security Officer at a regional bank, the opportunity to engage in large-scale
collaborations was immensely beneficial. However, in a hybrid work environment,
limited face-to-face interactions with colleagues sometimes posed difficulties
for newcomers to approach the appropriate individuals for help.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That was a challenge I gave myself when I joined NHIC a year later. I
wanted to make sure that my colleagues knew exactly who or where to turn
if they needed help,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>San San adeptly handles questions from her team on topics regarding corporate
administration and procurement processes. When they encounter issues submitting
claims, she patiently guides them through the process. When they require
assistance beyond her expertise, she directs them to the appropriate individuals,
such as the specific IT staff for login issues. Even when additional help
is needed to man the booths at trade shows, San San would already be there
taking down queries from prospective industry partners and directing them
to her colleagues.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>
<br>“Unlike most of my colleagues, I do not have formal scientific training,
but I want them to feel assured in relying on me,” she added.</p>
<p>Hence, this “human help desk” seldom remains deskbound. At NHIC events
or meetings, you’ll often find San San striding around, ensuring meeting
rooms and catering stations are set up properly. Within minutes, she is
already stationed at the lobby welcoming guests. Calm and composed, San
San takes the first step to engage with guests —a task her introverted
self would have shied away from. However, it is not merely for small talk;
rather, she attentively notes their preferences, ensuring everyone feels
energised with a beverage or pastry of their choice before the meeting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you set out to serve others, there is no room for error,” she emphasised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This commitment was evident during <a href="https://www.cris.sg/newsroom/media-releases/221017-NHIC-media-release/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>the launch event of NHIC’s new Clinical Innovation and Adoption Initiative</u></a> to
nurture promising healthtech projects for adoption and scaling across healthcare
clusters in Singapore in October 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then only two months into her new role, San San was already like a fish
in water. Tasked to manage the catering and RSVPs, she effortlessly navigated
the various processes, while still paying attention to the most minute
details. With over 100 guests in attendance for the milestone event, San
San meticulously gathered their dietary preferences, reviewed menus consistently
and liaised with caterers to label all allergens accurately.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Admin Professionals' Day/Ng_San_San_5.jpg">
</div>
<p>When asked about the laborious nature of the process, San San highlighted
the importance of thoroughness and added with a smile, “Although food is
just one aspect of the event, our guests and VIPs should still feel reassured
and comfortable.”</p>
<p>How does San San manage her work effectively while on the move? She attributes
this to the “careful adoption of technologies”, a skillset she learnt during
her time at the bank. Sporting her phone secured with her iconic champagne
gold crossbody strap, she uses apps such as Microsoft 365 and OneDrive
to access information seamlessly. These tools allow her to check time-sensitive
emails or retrieve necessary details on the fly”, free from the confines
of her desk.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Admin Professionals' Day/Ng_San_San_6.jpg">
</div>
<p>Understanding the importance of keeping her skills relevant, San San regularly
reads up on technologies that could enhance the efficiency of her work,
such as apps which automate the mundane task of appointment scheduling
or document filing. She believes that with the freed-up time, more energy
can be allocated to enhancing workflows, planning tasks and ultimately,
providing improved service to stakeholders.</p>
<h4><strong>Finding her place in healthcare</strong></h4>
<p>Asked if she had ever considered joining the hospitality industry, given
its reputation for exemplary service, San San laughed and said her passion
will always lie in healthcare.</p>
<p>In 2007, she joined a private specialist healthcare provider, serving
as the Assistant Operating Theatre Manager for Lasik surgery. San San recalled
her quiet interactions with the patients, many of whom experienced anxiety
prior to the surgery. “Sometimes speaking to them may make them more nervous”,
she noted. Instead, she would offer comfort by holding their hands or giving
gentle pats on the back. As patients may exit the theatre feeling groggy,
San San would have eye drops ready to alleviate their discomfort, ensuring
their well-being before they left the clinic.</p>
<p>“Not a day felt like work,” she shared warmly.</p>
<p>The three years cemented her love for patient care. Even as she searched
for new jobs after taking breaks due to family commitments, San San found
herself continually drawn to opportunities within the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to many, San San initially joined NHIC as a Grants Administration
Executive in 2016. From setting-up evaluation panel meetings to preparing
post-grant documents, San San excelled in every aspect of her role. As
the number of grant schemes increased, so did her responsibilities. San
San took up corporate support roles in procurement and secretariat duties
for board meetings. However, she left a year and a half later due to family
commitments.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Admin Professionals' Day/Ng_San_San_4.jpg">
</div>
<p>“NHIC is a different form of patient care. It provided me with opportunities
to engage with the clinical community, collaborate with partners in the
government sector and perhaps, play a part in advancing our local healthcare
innovation landscape, even in the smallest of ways,” she said, reflecting
on her decision to return to NHIC years later.</p>
<h4><strong>A commitment to service</strong></h4>
<p>Asked how her younger self would respond to her journey, San San gave
a shy smile as she reflected on her 20-year career. “I believe she would
be proud of how much I have grown out of my comfort zone, and in my passion
for service,” she mused.</p>
<p>There were moments during her career breaks when she feared she had “lost
touch with the service aspect” — the ability to connect with people and
anticipate their needs. “Thankfully, I did not retreat back into my shell.
Things have not only worked out but continued to improve,” she said.</p>
<p>At CRIS’ first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crissg_criscelebrates-movienight-npmsg-activity-7127829372425695233-P0kJ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Dinner &amp; Dance last year</u></a>,
the NHIC team dressed up as characters from Marvel movies. While her colleagues
portrayed lead heroes like Loki or Thor, San San chose to be a Dora Milaje,
a supporting role in the movie but the loyal bodyguard of Black Panther;
a character that reflected her comfort in providing support behind the
scenes while having the competency to hold her own.</p>

</div>
<p>Being an administrative professional is no longer a traditional deskbound
job. Over decades, it has evolved into a multifaceted role today. On her
LinkedIn, San San proudly wrote, “Service is in my blood and I find joy
in the ability to bring smiles”, a daily affirmation to drive her commitment
in supporting NHIC operations to the best of her abilities.</p>
<p>At the heart of her journey lies a commitment to service — the spark she’ll
always attribute to her mentor. Although he has since passed on, she remains
grateful to him for recognising her potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He showed me that my reserved nature was not a limitation but rather
a valuable asset I could use to support others,” San San reflects with
a smile, as she calmly strides off to set up a meeting.
