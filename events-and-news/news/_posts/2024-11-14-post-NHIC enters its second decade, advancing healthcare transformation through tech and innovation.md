<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 14 November 2024 </strong>– The National Health Innovation
Centre Singapore (NHIC) marked its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary today, commemorating
a decade of groundbreaking progress in providing strong support to public
healthcare institutions for the translation and commercialisation of clinical
innovations to address unmet clinical needs in Singapore and beyond. At
the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Dinner, graced by Dr Janil Puthucheary,
Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Digital Development and Information,
and Ministry of Health, NHIC affirmed its mission for the years ahead:
to focus on healthcare innovations that drive systems-level healthcare
transformation to ensure that innovations developed can be implemented
and scalable to bring benefits across the whole healthcare ecosystem. NHIC
will also intensify its efforts to address complex healthcare challenges
through comprehensive and integrated strategies, leveraging its decade
of expertise in pioneering advancements in medical technologies and solutions.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<h4><strong>Uplifting Singapore’s healthcare clusters for healthcare innovation&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Over the past ten years, NHIC has played a pivotal role in guiding healthcare
innovators through the process of translating early-stage ideas into market-ready
solutions that address unmet clinical needs. By ensuring these innovations
meet regulatory requirements, align with clinical workflows, and are applicable
in real-world settings, NHIC has enabled more than 100 innovation projects
across public healthcare institutions (PHIs), leading to enhanced healthcare
outcomes and close to $90 million of investments from private capital poured
into developing these innovations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHIC’s commitment to nurturing a vibrant healthcare innovation ecosystem
is evident in its comprehensive support through robust funding schemes,
strategic guidance, talent development, and accelerating these clinical
innovations towards commercialisation via industry and international partnerships.
Additionally, NHIC has supported healthcare cluster partners through grants
for project development and intellectual property filing, further strengthening
the ecosystem.</p>
<p>These complementary efforts have successfully led to the commercialisation
of several high-impact technologies, including novel medical devices, breakthroughs
in therapeutics, and advanced diagnostic tools, resulting in 72 licenses
facilitated, $4.38 million in licensing revenue, the creation of 25 start-up
companies, and the launch of 16 products. <a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/resources/media-centre/news/2024/september/singapore-rises-to-4th-place-in-global-innovation-index-its-best-rank-in-more-than-a-decade" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Global benchmarking analysis of Innovation &amp; Enterprise (I&amp;E) activities indicate that Singapore demonstrates strong performance in start-up creation and investment raised, placing us amongst the top in the world on the Global Innovation&nbsp;Index.</a>
</p>
<h4><strong>NHIC offers full spectrum support to uplift promising innovations that address unmet clinical needs</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Improving skin health for individuals who are struggling with acne</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For instance, a grant by NHIC's <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/funding/develop-i2d/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Innovation to Develop (I2D) scheme</a> was
awarded to Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School
of Medicine, that led to the start-up company, ArrowBiome. With the grant,
along with holistic support in areas such as regulatory and commercial
expertise, ArrowBiome advanced the commercialisation of their innovative
microbiome management solution, which selectively targets acne-causing
bacteria to balance the skin microbiome in patients with acne. The financial
and developmental support provided by NHIC enabled ArrowBiome to be equipped
with the essential resources and infrastructure needed to advance from
concept and inch closer to a market-ready product, even while the technology
was incubating at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology
(SMART) and the Nanyang Technological University’s Lee Kong Chian School
of Medicine.</p>
<p><strong><u>Better care and patient safety for mothers undergoing childbirth</u></strong>
</p>
<p>A team at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) identified an unmet
clinical need in administering spinal anaesthesia accurately to women in
labour during childbirth to reduce post-delivery trauma and complications.</p>
<p>In the past, the success rate of first-attempt injection of spinal anaesthesia
was 70 per cent, as this is based on clinical skills, visual estimation
and palpation of the spine. Hence, there was an unmet clinical need to
tap on technology to increase the first-attempt injection success rate
to enhance safety and improve patient experience, while also enabling clinicians,
midwives and nurses to assist in this procedure with greater accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing this need is uSINE®, – the world’s first AI-powered ultrasound-guided
automated spinal landmark identification system, which increased the first-attempt
injection success rate to 92 per cent for women in the healthy weight range
and 82 per cent for obese women. uSINE® technology was developed with support
from NHIC’s I2D scheme, and incorporated as a start-up, HiCura Medical
Pte Ltd, a National University of Singapore (NUS) spin-off company. Throughout
the process, NHIC provided valuable guidance on key aspects such as insights
into navigating regulatory guidelines, commercial viability, and considerations
for public procurement. HiCura Medical Pte Ltd co-developed the technology’s
clinical application with KKH, supported by NHIC’s <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/funding/industry-i2i/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Innovation to Industry (I2I) scheme</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>uSINE® was eventually implemented in KKH in May 2023 and has also secured
approval from the Health Sciences Authority for use in other healthcare
institutions in Singapore. With support from NHIC’s Clinical Innovation
&amp; Adoption Initiative (I2Adopt), the team is currently implementing
uSINE® in selected PHIs.</p>
<h4><strong>Enhanced support for healthcare innovations: NHIC’s I2Adopt spurs innovative healthcare solutions to implement and scale across healthcare clusters</strong></h4>
<p>NHIC's I2Adopt, an enhanced support initiative for healthcare clusters
and innovators, launched in October 2022, was developed to foster stronger
collaborations with respective local healthcare cluster partners, agencies
and offices to implement cost-effective innovations. Going beyond individual
projects, NHIC partners with healthcare clusters to identify and smoothen
barriers that currently hinder the implementation and adoption of healthcare
innovations that could bring benefits across the whole healthcare ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this sharpened focus, innovations can prove that their technology
is viable for use in Singapore which in turn allows them to set their sights
further beyond Singapore to create global impact.</p>
<p>One significant development since, is the collaboration between two PHIs
– Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) –
and Mesh Bio. Under the NHIC I2Adopt initiative, a grant of $1 million
was awarded to the two PHIs to enable the implementation and adoption ofHealthVector
Diabetes (HVD), a software medical device based on digital twin technology,
that provides an estimate of the three-year risk for chronic kidney disease
in patients with diabetes.</p>
<h4><strong>Strengthening partnerships with healthcare clusters to drive systems-level healthcare transformation</strong></h4>
<p>As it enters its second decade, NHIC will partner closely with healthcare
clusters to select and resource high potential projects, catapulting them
towards market readiness, increasing their value and impact. Under this
pilot, which is an extension of NHIC’s I2D scheme, promising projects by
PHIs can receive a grant of up to $1 million in project funding and other
support from NHIC to address common challenges of adequate resourcing to
bring medical innovations towards clinic and market readiness. The support
will also facilitate further scaling of technologies, to draw in private-sector
support for commercial and financial viability. Through this comprehensive
approach, the scheme aspires to synergise greater public-private partnerships
to accelerate commercialisation.</p>
<h4><strong>Rising Star Healthcare Innovation Tributes – Honouring Local Innovations and Public-Private Partnerships</strong></h4>
<p>In conjunction with its 10<sup>th </sup>anniversary, NHIC also awarded
Rising Star Healthcare Innovation Tributes to deserving local enterprises
that have shown strong partnerships with healthcare institutions to implement
new technologies to scale. These tributes highlight the outstanding achievements
of local biomedical and healthcare innovations and celebrate strong public-private
partnerships to fuel patient care and healthcare impact over the past decade.</p>
<h4><strong>Honouring the work of Founding Chairman, Professor Ranga Krishnan</strong></h4>
<p>A special tribute was also accorded to Professor Ranga Krishnan as the
founding chairman of NHIC. Dr Janil Puthucheary presented him with a commemorative
token to celebrate his ground-breaking contributions and visionary guidance
during his tenure, acknowledging his strong stewardship in steering NHIC
as an enabler to support Singapore’s healthcare innovation ecosystem towards
success. While he has relinquished his role in NHIC, he is still the Chairman
of the National Medical Research Council (NMRC) – which oversees the development
and advancement of medical research in Singapore. As the Chairman, he continues
to guide the NMRC Office in its implementation of research funding programmes
to strengthen Singapore’s healthcare research and innovation ecosystem.
