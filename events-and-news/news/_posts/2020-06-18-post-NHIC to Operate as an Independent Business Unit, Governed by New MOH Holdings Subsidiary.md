#### **About the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation Singapore (CRIS)**

The **Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation Singapore (CRIS)**, a wholly owned subsidiary of MOH Holdings, has been established in 2020 with the goal of strengthening synergies and promulgating strategies for national-level clinical research and translation programmes that are under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health (MOH).    

CRIS has been formed by repurposing the former Singapore Clinical Research Institute Pte Ltd and brings together the following five entities as business units under a common management and governance structure:

*   _Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute Singapore_ (ACTRIS)
*   _Precision Health Research Programme Singapore_ (PRECISE), and
*   _Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium_ (STCC).

Each business unit will continue to be accountable to their respective Board Oversight Committees for deliverables. The CRIS Board and CRIS HQ will address corporate governance and support matters, and optimise synergies in operations and research efforts across these entities.

CRIS aims to make a positive difference to Singapore patients and researchers by ensuring that these clinical research platforms and programmes are at the cutting edge of capability development and innovation, through facilitated collaborations and enduring partnerships with research and biomedical entities and communities across the public sector and industry in Singapore.
