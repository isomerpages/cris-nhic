<h3><strong>NHG Centre for Medical Technologies &amp; Innovations (CMTi) and National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC) Joint MedTech Grant Call</strong></h3>
<p>To encourage innovation in healthcare, the NHG Centre for Medical Technologies
and Innovations (CMTi) and NHIC rolled out the NHG CMTi-NHIC Joint MedTech
Grant, which provides internal seed funding for the development of innovative
MedTech solutions. This grant aims to fund the early stage development
of technological solutions that are commercially viable to resolve unmet
needs in healthcare. Potential areas for MedTech innovation include, but
are not limited to, medical devices, diagnostics, and digital applications.</p>
<p>The Centre for Medical Technologies and Innovations (CMTi) is NHG’s primary
engine that drives innovation through the translation of ideas into implementable
products, bridging the gap between unmet clinical needs, MedTech development,
and innovative healthcare solutions. CMTi continuously looks out for opportunities
to foster meaningful partnerships and builds its strategic innovation ecosystem
with both local and international partners spanning across industry, academia,
research and government sectors. From assessing problem statements and
use cases, to building and supporting the navigation to resources, strategizing
the right collaborative approach with our partners, and finally solution
adoption and healthcare implementation, CMTi is fully equipped with a productization
strategy for efficient business model execution.</p>
<p>Innovation teams may leverage on the potential outcomes of this seed funding
