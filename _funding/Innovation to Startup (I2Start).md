##### Aim

I2Start program is a streamlined funding pathway which brings together three institutions: SMART, NHIC and Enterprise Singapore, in a manner to support company formation around health and biomedical science innovations.

An I2Start application **must clearly illustrate** the **technical feasibility** of the technology, a defined **go-to-market strategy**, and demonstrate the **potential for translation** to a point where the technology would be **attractive for a start-up company formation**.

##### Eligibility

The team **must** consist of **one Clinical Principal Investigator** and **one Technical Principal Investigator** from Singapore’s publicly-funded institutions. The team should have a **strong intention to start-up a company**.

The Clinical PI must hold a primary appointment in a public healthcare institution or academic medical school in Singapore and be salaried by the institution.

The Technical PI must be employed by public-funded institution in Singapore (e.g. NUS, NTU, SUTD, SIT, SIM, SMU, A\*STAR Institutions, Polytechnics, CREATE Institutions, SGH, DUKE-NUS, NUH and etc.). The Technical PI must have relevant scientific/technical background and possess necessary experience to co-direct the project being supported by the grant.

##### Funding Process

![funding quantum i2s1a](https://nhic.sg/web/images/NHIC/funding-quantum-i2s1a.jpg)

All I2Start grant applications will be jointly evaluated by the 3 funding agencies.

Upon meeting the approved Phase 1 milestones, the project will transit into Phase 2, where it will be funded under NHIC I2D grant^. In parallel, ENTERPRISE SINGAPORE will provide a Letter of Intent to support the continuation of the project through the formation of a startup company.

Upon meeting the approved Phase 2 milestones and the required requisites\*\*, the project will transit into Phase 3, whereby the startup company will be supported under Startup SG Tech POC/POV grant^. (To find out more general information about the ENTERPRISE SINGAPORE Startup SG Tech grant, please visit [Startup SG Tech](https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/programmes/4897/startup-sg-tech/frequently-asked-questions)).
