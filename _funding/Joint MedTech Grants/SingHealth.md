##### SingHealth Joint MedTech Grant


### SingHealth – National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC) Joint Medical Technology (MedTech) Grant

**![logo singhealth](https://nhic.sg/web/images/NHIC/logo_singhealth.jpg)**

In 2015, SingHealth and NHIC collaborated and rolled out the annual&nbsp;**SingHealth – NHIC Joint MedTech Grant**, which funds feasibility studies and deserving pilot projects prior to embarking on NHIC applications.

**Medical technology**&nbsp;development is a research growth area for SingHealth, which aims to bring novel healthcare technology solutions to the patients’ bedside. The advancement of medical technology is a mission of the SingHealth Medical Technology Office (MTO), a core platform under the SingHealth Office of Research (OoR). One of MTO’s key roles is to link researchers and their validated clinical problem with technological solutions – with an end goal of improving patient care through clinically relevant technology.

This jointly supported grant aims to:

*   provide&nbsp;**seed funding**&nbsp;for investigators to explore novel research ideas,
*   support exploratory efforts for early-stage projects that involve an unmet clinical need
*   show potential for further development with the next stage of POC funding.
