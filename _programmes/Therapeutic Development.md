The **Singapore Therapeutics Development Review (STDR)** is a national-level grant call for public sector research, implemented by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) in partnership with our strategic partners, the Experimental Drug Development Centre (EDDC), Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and National Health Innovation Centre (NHIC).

STDR aims to boost the quality and quantity of drug development and biotech pipelines in Singapore through 2 key features:

*   Phased funding support to potential high-value drug discovery and development projects from the local public sector research community, based on the maturity and industry-readiness of projects; and
*   Mentoring from leading entrepreneurs, innovators and/or venture capitalists, training through bootcamps, workshops and/or seminars, as well as industry networking opportunities to provide dedicated guidance and upskilling opportunities to grant awardees.
