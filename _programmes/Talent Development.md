NHIC is partnering with SGInnovate to nurture founders and senior innovation project leads with tri-competent capabilities in clinical, technical and commercial experience in the healthtech sectors. This talent development programme will groom innovators who could assume positions as future founders of home-grown biotech or medtech startups, or become innovation leaders at companies. Talents will be given with opportunities to immerse themselves in real-world environments, both in public and private sector settings, to experience how to design, develop and bring clinical innovations to market.
