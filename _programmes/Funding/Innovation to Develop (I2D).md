</div>
<h5><strong>Aim</strong></h5>
<p>This funding is for development of a clinically significant and commercially
viable healthcare innovation. The grant application must clearly illustrate
the scientific merit, competitive advantage and technical feasibility of
the project. Additionally, it must demonstrate potential for translation
to a point where the technology would be attractive to an industry partner
or follow-on funder.</p>
<h5><strong>Funding criteria</strong></h5>
<p>Grant applications that emphasise on the following aspects of the project
are considered for funding:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Well defined unmet healthcare need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proven scientific merit with proof-of-concept data in&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;research/laboratory
models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong intellectual property position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed development plan highlighting future project work, milestones,
endpoints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear and achievable commercial plan outlining the proposed route to market,
competing technologies and potential industry partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential to result in reduced healthcare costs, delivering cost-effective
treatment or adoption by the healthcare system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Funding quantum</strong></h5>
<p>A funding quantum capped at S$300,000 (inclusive of max. 30% indirect
costs) will be awarded to the host institution on a reimbursement basis
for expenses incurred by project teams towards the development of proposed
technology.</p>
<h5><strong>Funding Duration</strong></h5>
<p>The funding support is up to 1 year with a maximum possible extension
of 6 months (subject to approval by NHIC).</p>
<h5><strong>Eligibility</strong></h5>
<p>The Principal Investigator must hold a primary appointment in and be under
the employment of a public healthcare institution or academic medical school
in Singapore. Project teams must have strong clinical representation. Collaborations
with industry are encouraged if they strengthen the proposal. All applications
are considered based on merit and eligibility is not limited to NMRC-funded
research.</p>
<p>Only one re-submission is allowed.</p>
<h5><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></h5>
