<h4><strong>Funding which supports commercially viable innovation for implementation, adoption</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Aim</strong></h5>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Identify and evaluate implementation feasibility </strong>of
innovations for adoption and scaling across public healthcare clusters
in Singapore.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engage clusters, clinicians, policy divisions
to understand barriers to adoption and encourage commitment to adoption/scaling
if barriers are addressed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Strategies and resources </strong>required
to address barriers to adoption/scaling.</p>
<h5><strong>Eligibility</strong></h5>
<p>The Principal Investigator must hold a primary appointment in and be under
the employment of a public healthcare institution in Singapore.</p>
<p>Considerations for projects gearing toward clinical adoption:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ability to implement a solution prioritised by your Cluster in (i) at
least three sites <u>and</u> (ii) in one other cluster(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved/Registered or close to regulatory approval or registration; ethics
submission or approval (as applicable).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial position: Industry partner’s commitment to pilot at scale for
eventual implementation and adoption cross cluster. Industry partner should
show independent financial capabilities beyond grants received through
this pilot.</p>
<h5><strong>Areas of Focus:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Focus Areas: </strong>Applications are encouraged to address these
areas of population health, mental health and ageing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposals in other areas that will also be considered include product
and/or process innovations that address business, workforce, or organisational
transformational needs in the public healthcare sector</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Product Innovation</strong> refers
to the introduction of a product or service that is new or shows significant
improvements with respect to its characteristics or intended uses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Process Innovation</strong> refers
to the implementation of a new of significantly improved delivery method,
with / without innovative technology, to improve core processes and operational
efficiencies to reach intended productivity goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Business Transformation</strong> refers
to transforming the way we serve the population and patients as One Healthcare.
This includes operation models, service models, business process re-engineering
and digitalization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Workforce Transformation</strong> refers
to transforming our healthcare workforce, so as to be productive, sustainable
and future-ready. This includes workforce restructuring, capability building,
jobs redesign, productivity and building a strong local core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Organisational transformation</strong> refers
to transforming the internal design and workings of agencies so that they
remain healthy, effective and future-ready. This includes leadership and
culture, organisational structure, organisational systems and processes,
management and people practices and workspaces.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Technology types: </strong>Sensors, wearables, robotics
and automation; these can be process and product innovations, and not limited
to the use of digital technologies.</p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp; Sensors &amp; Wearables (S&amp;W)</strong>
</p>
<p>Innovation that uses S&amp;W. For primary care applications, we are hoping
to dramatically (10x) the number of residents an individual doctor can
look after.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>
</p>
<p>National-level innovative AI solutions to improve operational efficiency,
patient outcomes, and/or user satisfaction per use case.</p>
<p><strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robotics and Automation (R&amp;A)</strong>
</p>
<p>Innovations that employ assistive and robotics solutions in back and front
room operations.</p>
<h5><strong>Funding criteria</strong></h5>
<p>Grant applications that emphasise the following aspects are considered
for funding:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Well defined unmet healthcare need incorporating Appropriate &amp; Value-Based
Care (AVBC) principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear deployment and product development strategy/roadmap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fair market assessment of technology conducted beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution must (or in queue to be prioritised) in the institutions’ IT
and other workplans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If applicable and necessary for implementation and scaling, solution must
have received regulatory approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential to result in reduced healthcare costs, improved clinical outcome
and eventual adoption by the healthcare system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross cluster deployment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
