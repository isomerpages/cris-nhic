<p>An I2Start application&nbsp;<strong>must clearly illustrate</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>technical feasibility</strong>&nbsp;of
the technology, a defined&nbsp;<strong>go-to-market strategy</strong>,
and demonstrate the&nbsp;<strong>potential for translation</strong>&nbsp;to
a point where the technology would be&nbsp;<strong>attractive for a start-up company formation</strong>.</p>
