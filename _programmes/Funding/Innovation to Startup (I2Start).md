##### **Aim**

I2Start program is a streamlined funding pathway which brings together three institutions: SMART, NHIC and Enterprise Singapore, in a manner to support company formation around health and biomedical science innovations.

An I2Start application&nbsp;**must clearly illustrate**&nbsp;the&nbsp;**technical feasibility**&nbsp;of the technology, a defined&nbsp;**go-to-market strategy**, and demonstrate the&nbsp;**potential for translation**&nbsp;to a point where the technology would be&nbsp;**attractive for a start-up company formation**.

##### **Eligibility**

The team&nbsp;**must**&nbsp;consist of&nbsp;**one Clinical Principal Investigator**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**one Technical Principal Investigator**&nbsp;from Singaporeâ€™s publicly-funded institutions. The team should have a&nbsp;**strong intention to start-up a company**.

The Clinical PI must hold a primary appointment in a public healthcare institution or academic medical school in Singapore and be salaried by the institution.

The Technical PI must be employed by public-funded institution in Singapore (e.g. NUS, NTU, SUTD, SIT, SIM, SMU, A\*STAR Institutions, Polytechnics, CREATE Institutions, SGH, DUKE-NUS, NUH and etc.). The Technical PI must have relevant scientific/technical background and possess necessary experience to co-direct the project being supported by the grant.

For any queries concerning eligibility, please contact the joint I2Start Grant Secretariat at&nbsp;[grant@nhic.cris.sg](mailto:grant@nhic.cris.sg).

##### **Funding criteria**

*   Strong intellectual property position
    
*   Demonstrated preliminary proof of-concept data in&nbsp;_in-vitro_&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;_in vivo_&nbsp;research/laboratory models (TRL 3\* and above)
    
*   Detailed technical and clinical development plan leading to a start-up, highlighting project scope, milestones and budget for each phase
    
*   Clear and achievable commercial plan outlining the unmet healthcare need, the proposed start-up structure and competitive landscape
    

_\* Definition: Technology Readiness Level 3 - Initial proof-of-concept demonstrated_

The project should&nbsp;**preferably fall under one of the following areas**:

*   Clinical diagnostics
    
*   Medical device and products
    
*   Digital health
    
*   Life science tools

##### **Funding Process**

![funding quantum i2s1a](/images/Funding/funding-quantum-i2s1a.jpg)

All I2Start grant applications will be jointly evaluated by the 3 funding agencies.

Successful applicants will be awarded SMART Innovation Grant^ under Phase 1, alongside a Letter of Intent from NHIC.

Upon meeting the approved Phase 1 milestones, the project will transit into Phase 2, where it will be funded under NHIC I2D grant^. In parallel, ENTERPRISE SINGAPORE will provide a Letter of Intent to support the continuation of the project through the formation of a startup company.

Upon meeting the approved Phase 2 milestones and the required requisites\*\*, the project will transit into Phase 3, whereby the startup company will be supported under Startup SG Tech POC/POV grant^. (To find out more general information about the ENTERPRISE SINGAPORE Startup SG Tech grant, please visit&nbsp;[Startup SG Tech](https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/programmes/4897/startup-sg-tech/frequently-asked-questions)).

**\*\* Requisites:**  
(1) Incorporate a company (start-up) with key members hired full-time with at least 30% local shareholding, and  
(2) License the IPs developed at SMART/ NHIC phase (Licensing agreement)

**Phase 1:**&nbsp;SMART Innovation Grant funding quantum is capped at S$300,000 (inclusive of 30% indirect costs) awarded to the host institution. The SMART Innovation Grant funding support is up to 1 year.

**Phase 2:**&nbsp;NHIC I2D funding quantum is capped at S$300,000 (inclusive of max. 30% indirect costs) awarded to the host institution. The NHIC I2D funding support is up to 1 year.
