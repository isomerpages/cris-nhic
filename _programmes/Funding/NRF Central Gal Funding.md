### NRF Central Gap Fund

The National Research Foundation (NRF) Central Gap Fund (“Central Gap”) supports impactful and preferably collaborative projects to translate research outcomes into products, processes and/or services that generate economic and societal benefits for Singapore. Projects awarded under Central Gap must aim to develop early technologies into working prototypes or functional processes that are closer to market, with the aim of attracting private sector investments and/or commercialisation receptacles to bring the technologies to full commercialisation or use. The quantum of funding is 2M SGD (inclusive of 30% overhead costs) and the project term is up to 24 months. For detailed information on the grant scheme ad eligibility, please visit the https://www.nrf.gov.sg/funding-grants/central-gap-fund&nbsp;

The National Healthcare Innovation centre (NHIC) is the designated Innovation and Enterprise Office (IEO) for public hospitals, public health institutions, and National Specialty Centres. All Central Gap applications from the public healthcare institutions must be endorsed by NHIC. &nbsp;Academic medical schools may opt to choose the designated IHL IEO or NHIC as preferred.

Please speak to one of the respective NHIC Cluster managers if you are interested in
applying for the Central Gap Fund.
