### Clinical Advancement and Development for Research, Entrepreneurship and Enterprise (CADRE2)

NHIC recently established stronger public-private partnerships as it launched its Clinical Advancement and Development for Research, Entrepreneurship and Enterprise (CADRE2) scheme in 2022. This programme works with private sector partners who are keen to co-develop and co-invest efforts support healthtech projects at the PHCs with Public Healthcare Clusters/Institutes in the early stages of the HealthTech commercialisation journey. This includes areas such as venture co-creation, technology development, co-investment and nurturing of tri-competent healthtech talent. By working closely with private sector partners from the initial stages of product development, clinician innovators will be able to identify viable commercial pathways for their healthtech innovations early on, and avoid downstream challenges of “technology-push” type innovations where the commercial value of the product may not be apparent. These collaborations play to the strengths of each sector; NHIC would identify and support the achievement of healthcare objectives, while private sector partners would introduce the commercial discipline that prepares projects to be market-ready and investable. NHIC has established more than 10 CADRE2 partnerships since the inception of this program.
