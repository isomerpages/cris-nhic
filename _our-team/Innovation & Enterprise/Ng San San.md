<p>Having been trained financially with a Diploma from Association of Chartered
Certified Accountants, San San has always been grateful for the opportunities
she had, to have experienced working systems spanning across various spaces,
including healthcare, education, banking and the public sector. They opened
her eyes to diversified ways of working and ideation processes, leading
her to place passion, efficiency and service quality as her highest life
goals, both professionally and personally.</p>
<p>Prior to NHIC, San San enjoyed all things administrative and operational
during her stints at Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and
United Overseas Bank (UOB). During which, planning VIP visits and co-ordinating
events never failed to get her adrenaline pumping.</p>
<p>Outside work, you will find her eagerly tasking herself with home improvement
projects and working out ways to increase efficiency of cleaning back home.</p>
