<p>Prior to joining NHIC, Esther was in SingHealth (SHHQ) focusing on ground
up innovation which entails nurturing handshakes to create conditions and
processes for innovation. She led a team to facilitate partnerships thru
co-developing innovation with start-ups, SMEs (funded by Enterprise Singapore)
and Institutes of Higher Learning, making such partnerships accessible
to innovators. This also included developing frameworks and enablers to
facilitate implementation and adoption of co-developed innovation. Prior
to this, Esther had the opportunity to manage a local SME, manufacturing
livestock feed additives, with a distribution network overseas. This also
presented an opportunity for Esther to develop business analytical, operational
experience in ISO certification, distributor networks and import/export
licensing. Esther has gleaned valuable experience in tech transfer at NUS
Industry Liaison Office, managing an intellectual property portfolio in
biochemistry, bioengineering as well as contract negotiations covering
material transfer, collaborations and licensing.</p>
